# FourteenFish Developers Coding Task

In this coding task we will ask you to display JSON data on a HTML page using JavaScript. 

Please feel free to use Google to help you complete this task; we would like you to show us your current skills, but also your ability to self-learn as well! If you get stuck and cannot complete the task, please don't worry. Show us your code no matter how far you get â€“ even an incomplete solution will be a good demonstration of your abilities.

Obviously, the time it takes each individual developer to complete this task varies, but please don't feel obligated to spend too long on it. All we want is to get an idea of the work that you do.

Once we've had a look through your code, we'd love to chat to you about it and have you talk us through your approach. If you struggled with any part of the task, it would be a good opportunity to hear about the steps that you took to overcome any difficulties.

## Tools to use

You may use whatever IDE you wish to complete this task, however we do ask that you upload your repository to GitHub to demonstrate use of source control. Be sure to commit your code as you go along, as you would do when committing code in a real situation.

## What we've given you

In this repository, you have all the files that you need:
- the HTML page, `index.html`
- the CSS stylesheet, `style.css`
- JSON data via a remote URL (see below)

Please ignore `waves.css` and the `wave-effect` div, those are just there to look pretty and we don't expect you to make changes to it. (Though do feel free to edit it if you wish!)

In each of these files we have made a start for you, but how you choose to fulfill the specification requirements are entirely up to you.

## Specification

JSON data is loaded from the remote URL `https://api.fourteenfish.com/api/v2/developers/coding-task-data`

You will find an array of objects each containing the fields `id`, `name`, `image`, and `description`. Your task is to, using JavaScript, fetch the JSON data and display it on `index.html`.

What fields you use from the JSON object are up to you, but you should only display the details of **one fish at a time** depending on **what the user selects**. We've started you off with a drop down, but feel free to approach this however you like, for example using buttons or tabs.

Beyond just functionality, what we are looking for is your ability to **integrate with the existing page template**. We would like to see you demonstrate your **eye for detail**, and your sense of **UI/UX style**.

Good luck, we look forward to seeing your code!
